# Pseudostate

Statechart concepts include both concrete types of state, such as _atomic states_ and _compound states_ but also non-concrete, or abstract types of state such as _initial state_ and _history state_.  A state machine can only be resting in such concrete states; pseudostates are therefore not _really_ states that the machine can be in, hence the prefix _pseudo-_.
